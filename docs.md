Hi, I am recently learning devops. I have built a study plan, which will require me to build a object detection
inference API which can be deployed on a cloud server.

This is the first task, which is to build a docker image for yolov8.
- Install Docker, understand images, containers, Dockerfile
- Run YOLOv8 object detection, familiarize with basic inference process
- Use Docker to build YOLOv8 runtime environment
- Create Dockerfile and package YOLOv8 into Docker image
- Run Docker container and test object detection API

Please help me generate the workspace.
